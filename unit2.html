Hola clase.  I will be responding to questions included in your emails today.  Very excited about these projects!  I'm not familiar with many of the different festivals that you all have chosen, so I'm looking forward to learning about these with you all.  I say with you all, because I think it will be fun to show these in class. :):):)  
</p>
<p>
<b>For today and tomorrow, your goal should be to do the research on your festival and write a script.</b>  Share this document with me by the end of your class period.  Try to get half of the script written today and the rest written tomorrow.  Although you will have time in class next week, you be responsible for completing other classwork and meeting other deadlines.<br>
<i>These projects will be worth 100 points and due on Tuesday, September 7.</i> You will also have a couple of assessments coming on Tuesday, Sept. 7  over what you are working on in class next week, so plan accordingly!  Due to the assessments on Tuesday, we will begin the speeches on Wednesday now.
