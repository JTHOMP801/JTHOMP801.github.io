The code is set up to run off of google drive, the file past must be the same or it will have problems, mounting the drive without the right path is a pain to fix
Image_Processing_Fish_Recognizer is how we scraped and applied the cleaning criteria for the dataset
CS436_FishRecognizer_JoeThompsonWillThompson is our main file that ran the models
